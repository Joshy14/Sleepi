    <h2> Here are some frequently asked questions </h2>
    <h4> What happens when you sleep?</h4>
    <p> As you sleep, your brain works to physically repair your body and encode memory. In the process, your brain also flushes out waste that accumulates during your waking hours that may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. </p>

    <h4>How Much Sleep Do Adults Need?</h4>

    <p>Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep per night to feel their best. How much you personally need can depend on your activity levels, your genetics, and your physical health. For example, athletes and people who are extremely physically active may need to sleep nine hours. For older adults, sleep needs shorten by an hour to seven to eight hours per night.</p>

  <h4> Do Older Adults Experience More Sleep Problems? </h4>

    <p> As we age, we sleep less. Whether older adults actually need less sleep, or their brains are not able to regulate sleep to the same extent, is unknown. A reported 1 in 4 older adults experience tiredness that interferes with their daytime plans. Perhaps for these reasons, older adults also nap more often. </p>

 <h4> Why Is Sleep So Important? </h4>

    <p>We spend about a third of our time sleeping. Sleep is as essential to our survival and wellbeing as food and water are. Sleep impacts nearly every aspect of the body, affecting the brain, heart, and lungs, as well as metabolism, mood, and immune system. Physical, emotional, and mental health all depend, in part, on good sleep.</p>

     <h4>What Happens If You Donâ€™t Get Enough Sleep?</h4>

    <p>When you do not get enough sleep, you become sleep deprived. Sleep deprivation can affect you whether you have one night of poor sleep, or suffer from short sleep on a regular basis. In the short term, sleep deprivation affects your mood, judgment, and ability to focus. While sleep deprived, you might have trouble remembering things and be more prone to make errors at school or work. </p>
